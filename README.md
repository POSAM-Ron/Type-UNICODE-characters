The following script combines 3 individual scripts which.

send fractions,
send Greek letters,
send math symbols

to your text editor or word processor. Convenient keystrokes eliminate looking up the UNICODE for the insert. Message boxes describe usage and map the UNICODE characters to the keyboard.

The script requires that you have downloaded and installed the AHK program available at > https://autohotkey.com/download/.

However , if you just want to use the features of this script , you don't need to install the AHK program ; just run the executable version:

AHK Fractions & Greek & Math.exe.

You don't need to install this executable , just run it. If you link the file to your STARTUP folder in windows , the features will always be present and will-not conflict with other keystrokes (unless set in another program).
